Circuitry
---------

**Kirchoff's Voltage Law** the net voltage around a closed loop circuit is zero.

**Kirchoff's Current Law** the sum of currents entering/leaving a *node* is zero.

###Analogy of water flow and pressure

###DC & AC
- AC current is wavelike, called **sinusoidal**
- **root mean square** the meathod for converting AC to DC.
