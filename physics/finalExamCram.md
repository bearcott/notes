Physics Final Exam
------------------

##Vectors (CH1)
- **negative vectors** have the same magnitude but opposite direction
- **antiparallel vectors** have opposite directions
- **displacement** is a *straight line* vector that represents the start and end of a path. *not* the path itself.

	A - B = A + (-B)

- a **unit vector** has a magnitude of 1 regardless of direction. is distinguished by a (^) a caret or a *hat* ;)
- **scalar/dot product*: Aâ€¢B = |A||B|cos(theta)

#Motion along a straight line (CH2)
- **average velocity/acceleration** = slope. change/time
- **instantaneous velocity/acceleration** = limit -> x
- **speed** is scalar while **velocity** is a vector
