Physics Final Exam
------------------

###Vectors (CH1)
- **negative vectors** have the same magnitude but opposite direction
- **antiparallel vectors** have opposite directions
- **displacement** is a *straight line* vector that represents the start and end of a path. *not* the path itself.

	A - B = A + (-B)

- a **unit vector** has a magnitude of 1 regardless of direction. is distinguished by a (^) a caret or a *hat* ;)
- **scalar/dot product**: A•B = |A||B|cos(theta)

###Motion along a straight line (CH2)
- **average velocity/acceleration** = slope. change/time
- **instantaneous velocity/acceleration** = limit -> x
- **speed** is scalar while **velocity** is a vector
- acceleration has to do with concavity or curvature. When concave down, negative. Remember that second derivative is inflection point and first derivative is maximum and minimum.

**constant acceleration** 2.4
- a falling/sliding down/thrown in the air body has the constant acceleration of gravity. (ignoring air)
- displacement during an interval is equal to the area under the velocity graph. Similar to velocity is equal to area under acceleration.

**freely falling bodies** 2.5
- magnitude of constant gravity acceleration:

	g = 9.8m/s^2 = 980cm/s^2 = 32 ft/s^2

	(approximated near earth surface)

**velocity and position by integration** 2.6
- anoher equation 

	∆v = a * ∆t

- just use integrals or derivatives to jump between displacement > velocity > acceleration

	v = v0 + integral(f(a))|{t,0} 

###Kinematic Equations
- constant x acceleration

	x = x0 + v0*t + (1/2)a*t^2 <-- no v

	v = v0 + a*t <-- no x

	v^2 = v0^2 + 2a(x-x0) <-- no t

	x - x0 = (v0 + v)/2 <-- no a

###Motion in two or three dimensions (CH3)
- skipped for now (p69-75)
- when acceleration is perpendicular, angle changes
**motion in a curved path**
- when speed is:
	- constant: acceleration is normal
	- increasing: acceleration is ahead of normal
	- decreasing: acceleration is behind normal
**projectile motion**
- trajectory is determined by v0 and acceleration due to gravity
- gravity will displace at same rate regardless of horizontal forces
