##Torque

- torque is the measure of how force will cause an object to rotate

    T = (radius) * (Force) * sin(angle)

    *hence it is the cross product*

- it can be broken up into tangential (perpendicular) and radial (parallel) forces. *Torque is not radial, and is only tangiental*

    T = Ia

    *Tension = Moment of Inertia * angular acceleration* 

- linear acceleration multiplied by the radius is angular acceleration.

    A = a/r

    *linear acceleration = angular acceleration * radius*

- In the case of a pulley, the tension equation is modified.

    Fr = IA, Fr=T

    *where a is angular acceleration and T is torque.*

    F*r = Ia/r

    *where a is linear acceleration*

- When there are multiple forces you may use it in this form

    IA = Fr1 + Fr2 + Fr3...

- Torque also has this equation:

    T=w/A

    *where w is angular velocity and a is angular acceleration*

- w is angular acceleration

    w = v/r
