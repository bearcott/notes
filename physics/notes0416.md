**a few equations**

    escape velocity = (mass/radius)^0.5

    period = a^3/mass

    Mechanical Energy = Potential + Kinetic

- A uniform sphere will have *the same* force of gravity on other objects around it as long as the mass remains constant. (radius doesnt matter)

**When talking about 2 objects**

    F(g) = G * m1 * m2 / r^2

#fluids

    Density = M/V

    Pressure = (Density)(Gravity)(height (m))

    F Bouyancy (N) = weight of displaced water = mass of displaced water * g

    F Bouyancy (N) = Pressure * Area (not volume)

    or

    F Bouyancy (N) = (Density)(Gravity)(Volume) <-- height * area

    Weight (N) = mass(kg) * g

- for a liquid to support an object, the buoyant force must equal the weight.
    + for a object to stay above the liquid, the volume of object must equal volume of liquid displaced
