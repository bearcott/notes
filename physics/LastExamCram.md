#Last exam of the year. Gotta study.

#Waves
**period** or T. It is wavelength. (crest to crest)

**amplitude** middle to crest.

    T = 1/Frequency (Hz)

    Frequency (Hz) = Frequency (rad/s) / 2pi

**simple harmonic motion** is when the restoration force is the same as the displacement to the equilibrium.

    Frequency (rad/s) = (spring constant / mass)^0.5

    D => A , V => Aw , a => Aw^2

    v0 = -wAsin(∂) (positive) ∂ is phase angle
    v0 = -wAcos(∂) (negative) ∂ is phase angle

    ∂ = arctan(-v0 / (w * x0))

    Force = Spring Constant / x

- for simple harmonic motion, *angular speed* and *angular frequency* are the same!
- when transitioning from distance to velocity to acceleration, it is changed by the factor of angular acceleration (w).
