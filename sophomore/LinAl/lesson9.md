    inverse of matrix = det + adj

    Det(ab) = det(a)det(b)

    det(cA) = c^n * det(a)

    det(a + b) != det(a) + det(b)

    det(a) = 0 then it is not invertible.

    A^-1 = 1/(det(A)) * adj(A)

    det(a^t) = det(a)

If A is an nxn matrix then the following statements are true:
- a is invertible
- Ax = b has a unique solution for every column matrix b
- Ax = 0 has trivial solution
- A is row equivalent to In
- A can be written as a product of elementary operations
- |A| != 0
