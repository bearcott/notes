#Chapter 1.1

*linear* equations involve only constants and addition/subtraction

*nonlinear* equations involve everything else lol..

a **solution** of n variables involves n real numbers. When put together, these make up a **solution set**. To describe this, you need a *parametric representation.*

when a variable is **free** it can take on any real value.

**parametric representation**

if there is not enough information, adding another *parameter* such as `t` below is useful.

    x1 = 4-2*x2
    x1 = 4 - 2*t, x2 = t
    //where t is any real number
