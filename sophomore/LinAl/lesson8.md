**elementary row operations to solve determinant**
- flip two rows: flip sign
- add a multiple to another row: no change
- when you multiply a single row by c: c * determinant

**the determinant is zero if**
- an entire row or column is all zero
- two rows or columns are equal (or a multiple of another)


an **adjoint matrix** is a transposed cofactor matrix.
