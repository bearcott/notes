# Basis

- If a vector space V has one basis with n vectors, every basis for V has n vectors.

a **dimension** is the amount of vectors inside a set.
- if the vector is a 0, then dimension is 0.


# Basis, row/column space, rank of matrix

**row/column space**

*row space*
- reducing a matrix to row echelon form reveals a set of basis for that matrix. (these are the non-zero rows)
- transposing the matrix first results in a *column space* once reduced to row echelon
- dimension of both of these are the same
