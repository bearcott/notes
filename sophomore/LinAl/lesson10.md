# vector spaces

**vectors in R^n**

The sequence of `n` real numbers is called an `n` tuple
- vector operations/scalar multiplication can be applied to tuples
- basically any arithmatic property can be applied


**vector space** let `V` be a set where two operations (vector addition and scalar multiplication) are defined.
