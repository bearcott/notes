a **set** is not a **spanning set** if it cannot be represented by a linear combination of any number.

a **spanning set** is a subspace of a vector space if it is the smallest subspace inside the vector space.

**linear dependance**

- a set of vectors in a vector space is *linearly independent* if the vector equation `c1v1 + c2v2.. = 0` has only *trivial solution* `c1 = 0, c2 = 0`
  - otherwise linearly dependent
- a set of vectors is *linearly dependent* if one vector can be written as a linear combination of another vector.

**basis** something is a basis if conditions:

- S spans V
- S is linearly independent

    S = [(1,0,0)
         (0,1,0)
         (0,0,1)]

    this is the standard basis for R^3

**dimension**
