    ||v|| = sqrt(v1^2 + v2^2 ..) //length of a vector

Every vector in a standard basis for R^n has a unit vector that has length 1

    {i,j} = {(1,0),(0,1)}

vectors `u` and `v` are parallel if `u = cv`
- if c > 0 then same direction if c < 0 then opposite

if v is a nonzero vector in R^n then the vector:

    u = V / ||V||

has a length of 1 and has the same direction as v. `u` is called a unit vector in the direction of `v`

    distance(u,v) = ||u - v||

**dot product** is a scalar quantity

    u • v = u1v1 + u2v2

    cos(theta) = u • v / (||u|| * ||v||)
