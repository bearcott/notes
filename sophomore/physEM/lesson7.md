**equipotential** surfaces are where moving from a to b on the same surface does not change ur potential energy

- When all charges are at rest, the surface of a conductor is always an equipotential surface.

- when all charges are at rest, the entire solid volume of a conductor is at the same potential.
  - E = 0 inside a conductor, potential energy is constant plateau

a **capacitor** is an energy storage device.

When two equal charges are next to each other and are same charge:
- the potential never zero
- the electric field is zero at midpoint

When they are opposite charge:
- the potential is zero at midpoint
- the electric field is never zero.

When do you use `sin` or `cos`?
difference between volts, coloumbs?
