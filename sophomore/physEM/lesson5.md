# CH 22 cont.

    E = lambda / (2 * pi * e0 * r) // long wire charge
    E = sigma / (2 * e0) // sheet charge
    E = sigma /  e0 // plate charge

- lambda = charge / length
- sigma = charge / area
- ro = charge / volume

assume *electrostatic equillibrium* electric field is 0 inside an objects. Then there are no charges inside, unless on the surface.
- this is why charges are perpendicular.
