# Chapter 23

    V = Q * k / r //volts

    U = -q * Q * k / r //potential energy

*potential energy* is in respect to infinity where at infinity it is 0.


    Ka + Ua = Kb + Ub

    F = -q0E

    W = q0 * E (ya - yb)

    

Potential energy *increases* when an object is moving in a path of resistance, and *decreases* otherwise (because it turns into kinetic energy.)
