# Chapter 23

    U = V/q0

    V = Q * k / r //volts

    U = -q * Q * k / r //potential energy

*potential energy* is in respect to infinity where at infinity it is 0.


    Ka + Ua = Kb + Ub = 0.5 * m * v^2

    F = -q0E

    W = q0 * E (ya - yb)

    Potential Energy (multiple charges) = q0 * k * sum(q/r)

    Work = PEf = PEi

    Work = E * q0 * d * cos(theta)

    Electric Field = V/d

    V (or potential) = kq/r


- `r` is always distance from point to center of charge


Potential energy *increases* when an object is moving in a path of resistance, and *decreases* otherwise (because it turns into kinetic energy.)
- potential energy is the SAME inside a surface as it is ON THE SURFACE

The absolute positioning of elements does not change the potential energy, the only thing that changes it is the relative distance between them.

- Since the trajectory of the path is not considered, this is called *conservative.*

- potential of a hollow sphere is equal to the potential inside it. hence r(sphere)+r(inside)
