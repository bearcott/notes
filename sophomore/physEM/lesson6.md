    V = Q * k / r //volts

    U = -q * Q * k / r //potential energy

*potential energy* is in respect to infinity where at infinity it is 0.


    Ka + Ua = Kb + Ub = 0.5 * m * v^2

    F = -q0E

    W = q0 * E (ya - yb)



Potential energy *increases* when an object is moving in a path of resistance, and *decreases* otherwise (because it turns into kinetic energy.)

The absolute positioning of elements does not change the potential energy, the only thing that changes it is the relative distance between them.

- Since the trajectory of the path is not considered, this is called *conservative.*
