# CH 27 Magnetic Field

- **monopole** isolated magnetic field

    F = q * v x B
      = q * v * B * cos(theta)

- right hand rule (as v curls towards B)
  - if its negative, flip your hand
- one units of B is F/qv or T for tesla
  - 1 N / Ampere * m = T
  - or 1 N * s / C * m
- another unit of B is Gausse or G
  - it is 1e-4 times a tesla
