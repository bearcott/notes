when a charge is at relative rest, they exert **electrostatic** forces on each other.

*electric* came from the greek word *elektron* meaning amber. (since they discovered it by rubbing amber with wool. The amber conducted electricity)

when *plastic* rods go with *wool* they make negative charges.

when *glass rods* go with *silk* they make positive charges.

**proton** + mass 1.673x10^-27

**neutron** ~ mass 1.675x10^-27

**electron** - mass 9.109x10^-31

charge of an atom is determined by the amount of electrons and protons. Equal electrons/protons = neutral charge.
- in a stable atom, the **atomic number** is amount of electrons/protons.

**ionization** is the gain or loss of protons/electrons.

**conductors** permit easy movement of charges through objects while **insulators** do not.

**static electricity**

So it turns out that you get it because carpet is an *insulator* so you constantly build up a charge on you with no where to go. Hence, when you touch a *conductor* like a door knob it shocks u.

charging by **induction** is the process of changing another body's charges without losing any of your own.

**coulomb's law**

Electrical forces are proportional to distance.

    1/r^2

 When `radius` doubles, electrical force decreases to 1/4.

 **ï¿¼The magnitude of the electric force between two point charges is directly propor- tional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.**


    F = k|q1*q2|/r^2

`q1` and `q2` are the respective charges of the two objects. While `k` is a constant which depends on the units used.
