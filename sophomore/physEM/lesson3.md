**electric field lines** the direction of the electric field is a tangent at any point.
- field lines never intersect

*polarization* is where the positive and negative charges are separated.

###diapoles

*the net force of a diapole in a uniform field is zero*
- however their toque is not zero.


    torque = qE * distance * sin(theta)

    //qE is the force of the electric field

*electric diapole moment* - `p (C * m) = q * d`
- where `q` is the charge and `d` is distance
- pWater = 6.13 * 10^-30 C * m


The torque can be written in vector form:

    torque = p * E //these are all vectors.

The torque is greatest when `p` and `E` are *perpendicular*. and is 0 when thy are parallel.

    dW = t * displacement or dPHI = -pE* sin(theta) * dPHI

    total work = integral(phi1,ph2) -pE * sin(phi) * dPHI
               = pE * cos(PHI2) - pE * cos(PHI1)

    potential energy or U = -p * E //all vectors

- potential energy is most negative when the angle `PHI` between then is 0.
- Greatest when they are antiparallel. (`pi`)
- 0 when it is perpendicular (`pi/2`)
