**electric field lines** the direction of the electric field is a tangent at any point.
- field lines never intersect

*polarization* is where the positive and negative charges are separated.

###diapoles

*the net force of a diapole in a uniform field is zero*

    torque = qE * distance * sin(theta)


    p or electric diapole moment (C * m) = q * d

    pWater = 6.13 * 10^-30 C * m

The torque can be written in vector form:

    torque = p * E //these are all vectors.

*a diapole has no net force on any external electric field*
