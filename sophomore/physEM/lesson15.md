    F = q * v x B

**Magnetic Flux**

**Force on a current carrying conductor**

    F' = q * v0 * B
    J = n * q * vD
    F' = J * B / n

    F = n * F' * l * A
    F = J * A J * l * B
      = I * l * B

**Magnetic Moment**

    u = I * A

    Torque = u x B
           = u * B * sin(phi)

    U = -u * B

- put fingers in direction of current
- close towards the direction of loop
- thumb points to the magnetic moment
