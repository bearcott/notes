    I = dQ / dt
    current density (J) = I/A

**resistance**

    R = V/I

    R = Ohm meters * l / A

    R = resistivity of material (Ohm) * Length / Cross sectional area (A)

    R = electric field (E) / charge density (J)

    Resistivity rho = rho

    Conductivity C = 1/rho = sigma


Lattice vibrations are the source of temp. dependence of resistivity.

    change in rho / rho0 = C * (temp - temp0)

    E = J * rho //vector J and E, rho is constant

    J = E / rho //electric field / resistivity

**Resistivity & temp**

    R = Rref[1 + a(T - Tref)]


- a is temp constant for a metal
- for semiconductors, resistance decreases when temp increases

**EMF** electromotive force is an active source of energy/power (script E)

    EMF = I (R + r)

    I = scriptE / (R + r)

*current* is in all parts of a circuit as long as its in series.

**series**
- voltage is divided across each
- current is the same

**parallel**
- voltage is the same
- current is divided across each
