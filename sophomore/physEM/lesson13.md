# Exam 1

- Chapter 23, 24, 25 (only a portion)
  - skip 24.6
  - chapter 5: current/current density/resistance
- Homeworks up through 12

*in a circuit* - direction of current, higher to lower, negative sign when calculating `I * R`


    EMF = Va - Vb = IR //difference in potential equals the EMF
    //voltage of a battery

    Vab or EMF = scriptE - IR


`Va - Vb` is called *terminal voltage*

scriptE is an ideal source of EMF

*current is conserved* hence you cannot 'use it up' inside a circuit.
- current is the same no matter thickness of wire
- current can vary using even the same battery


*questions*
- would you subtract the 16V and not the 8V in 25.46?
