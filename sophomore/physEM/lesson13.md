# Exam 1

- Chapter 23, 24, 25 (only a portion)
  - skip 24.6
  - chapter 5: current/current density/resistance
- Homeworks up through 12

*in a circuit* - direction of current, higher to lower, negative sign when calculating `I * R`


    EMF = Va - Vb = IR //difference in potential equals the EMF
    //voltage of a battery

    Vab or EMF = scriptE - IR

    P = V * I = I^2 * R

    W = P * time in seconds


`Va - Vb` is called *terminal voltage*

scriptE is an ideal source of EMF

*current is conserved* hence you cannot 'use it up' inside a circuit.
- current is the same no matter thickness of wire
- current can vary using even the same battery

**power** is
- the rate of energy dissipated across something
- the rate at which energy is converted to another form
- ITS A RATE `V * I`


*questions*
- would you subtract the 16V and not the 8V in 25.46?
- is EMF the potential difference?
