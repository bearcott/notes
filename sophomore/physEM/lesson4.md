# CH 22 Gauss's Law

    **Flux (phi)** = Energy * Area * cos(theta)

    Flux = âˆ«E * d * A * cos(theta) = +qnet/E0

This is equation from *gauss's law*. You can derive *coloumbs* law from this equation.

*if there is no net charge inside a surface, there is no net flux*
- there can still be an electric field through object
