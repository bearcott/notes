# CH 22 Gauss's Law

*electric flux is directly porportional to the magnitude of the net charge inside the surface*

there are *three* cases where there is no net flux:

1. An empty box with E = 0;
2. A box containing one positive and one equal magnitude negative point charge.
3. An empty box immersed in a uniform electric field.


*Gauss's law* can be summarized as:

1. outward/inward flux depends on the sign of the net charge inside.
2. if there is no net charge inside a surface, there is no net flux
  - there can still be an electric field through object
  - these electric fields *do not* change net flux.
3. net electric *flux* is proportional to the net charge inside the surface but otherwise is independent of the surface.

The equation for flux in a uniform electric field:

    **Flux (phi)** = Energy * Area * cos(theta)

    Flux = âˆ«E * d * A * cos(theta) = +qnet/E0

    q = flux * permittivity

This is equation from *gauss's law*. You can derive *coloumbs* law from this equation.
- the same concept applies to fluid dynamics
- instead of `E` it would be velocity of water.

A **gaussian surface** doesn't need to be made of anything, it is merely an imaginary closed shape which we define.

*total flux is equal to the sum of all smaller flux inside*

**general form of gauss's law**

    e0 = 8.854 * 10^-12 C^2/N*m^2

In the case of a flat surface:

    Flux = E * A <- where both are vectors

- the force A is the normal to the surface
- E is the force of the electric flux

*an electric field line that enters a surface containing no charge must exit it too*

*the flux on a surface is always perpendicular to the surface it exits*
