When given a dielectric constant, the charge is

    Q = C*V*dielectric constant

*air is dialectric*

- most insulators are dielectric field
- there is no charge inside dielectric field
- only on the ends are there charges


    K (kappa) = Applied Field E0 / Resultant Field E >= 1

if V0 is fixed

    C0 = Q0 / V0 -> C = K * Q0 / V0 = K * C0

**current** amount of charge past per unit time

    I = change in Q / change in t

**current density** is vector `J = I/area = A/m^2`


    A = Ampere = Coulomb / second

*electron drifting*
- `Vd` is electron drifting


    n = # charges / volume
    change in Q = concentration or number of particles (n) * charge of electron (e) * length (l) * cross sectional area (A)
    l = Vd * change in time
    I = n * e * drift velocity (Vd) * A
    current density (J) = I / A = n * e * Vd
