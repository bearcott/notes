# Capacitors

    C = Q/V
      = (e0 * A) / d //parallel plate
      = (4 * pi * e0 * a * b)/(b - a) //spherical
      = (2 * pi * e0 * L)/ln(b / a) //cylinder
      = 4 * pi * e0 * a //spherical if b went to infinity

- when calculating area you have to convert m^2 to cm^2 not m to cm

**capacitance** does not change with Q and V, it only changes on physical shit

**potential difference** voltage

**farads**
- micro 10^-6
- pica 10^-12

**Parallel Plate Capacitor**

**Spherical Capacitor**

**capacitors in parallel**

    V0 = V1 + V2 + V3

    V0 = Q[1/C1 + 1/C2 + 1/C3]

    V0/Q = 1/Cequiv

    Cequiv = C1 * C2 / (C1 + C2) //only 2 capacitors

    Qtotal = Q1 + Q2 + Q3

    Cequiv = Qtotal/V0 = C1 + C2 + C3 // parallel

    Cequiv = 1 / (1/C1 + 1/C2 + 1/C3) //series

- potential difference across all capacitors in parallel has to be the same
- the charge must be the same across all capacitors in a series

*question 24.2*

**energy in a capacitor**

    W = U = qdV = 1/2 CV0^2
