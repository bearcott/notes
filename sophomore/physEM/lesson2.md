**current** is the flow of *positive* charge

the *electric field* opposes the positive direction and flows towards the negative.

The distribution for the electric field of a single particle
- this will change once u add more


    E Î± 1/r^2 //proportional to

electric field equation

    E = (kQ/r^2)R

    Q = q1*q2

where:
- R is a vector
- r is a radius
- E is electric field energy
- k is a constant
- Q is charge

Force will be parallel if q1q2 > 0. Its antiparallel if q1q2 < 0.

It is *attracted* if q1q2 are opposite signs.


    k = 1/(4*pi*e0)

*test charges* are usually positive small charges. (aka `q0`)

*principle of super position forces* when two forces act on a third, the result is the addition of their vectors
