## CH21.3

- a micro second is `10^-6` of a second
- The SI unit for an electric charge is called a **coloumb** (C)
  - one electron/proton = 1.6021764871402 * 10^-19 C
  - One C = 6.241 * 10^18 electrons/protons.
  - 1 uC = 10^-6 C (micro)
  - 1 nC = 10^-9 C (nano)
- **current** is the flow of *positive* charge


*principle of super position forces* when two forces act on a third, the result is the addition of their vectors.
- hence consider things you learned last year in physics for vector addition.
  - using `sin` and `cos` to break vectors into components.
  - draw vector diagrams for visualization!!

*insulators inhibit the flow of electrons through them*

**electric field**

the *electric field* opposes the positive direction and flows towards the negative.

The distribution for the electric field of a single particle
- this will change once u add more

    E Î± 1/r^2 //proportional to

electric field equation

    E = (kQ/r^2)R

    Q = q1*q2

where:
- R is a vector
- r is a radius
- E is electric field energy
- k is a constant
- Q is charge

Force will be parallel if q1q2 > 0. Its antiparallel if q1q2 < 0.

It is *attracted* if q1q2 are opposite signs.

    k = 1/(4*pi*e0)

*test charges* are usually positive small charges. (aka `q0`)

    E = F0/q0

- E is electric field vector
- F0 is the force exerted on q.
- when q is positive E and F0 same direction
  - else opposite directions


*charge can be transferred through contact*

*coloumb's law should only be applied in a vaccuum*

**lambda (l)** represents the linear charge density such as a rod.

**sigma (o)** represents surface charge density

**rho (p)** represents volume charge density

### Misc

Also it is important to relate to several physics qualities.

Such as the equation for kinetic energy.

    K = 0.5 * m * v^2
