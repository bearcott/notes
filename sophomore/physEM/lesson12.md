**Circuits**

voltmeter
- inside a volt meter there is a resistor thats much higher than R.
  - this is so that the current flows through the main circuit not through the voltmeter
    - current flows more through less resistance
    - its in parallel

ampmeter
- resistance very low, less than R. flows in series


    Power = dU/dt -> [J]/[p] -> Watts (W)

    P = V * I

    V = I * R

    Terminal Voltage (V) = EMF - I * R


    I = I1 + I2 + I3

    E (total volt) = I( 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3) //parallel
    E (total volt) = I( R1 + R2 + R3) //series
