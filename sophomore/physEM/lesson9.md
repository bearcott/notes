    U = 0.5 * C * V^2
      = Q^2/ (2 * C)

    //energy density between plates
    U / (A * d) = U / V = 0.5 * e0 * E^2


the force on one electric plate in a capacitor is

    E = sigma * Q / e0

- Basically the electric field on one plate multiplied by the force from the other

**dialectric**
because there is an insulating material *the electric field decreases* because the neutral charge inside the insulating material polarizes the charged conducting material
