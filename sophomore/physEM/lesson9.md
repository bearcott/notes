    //known as stored energy
    U (J) = 0.5 * C * V^2
      = Q^2/ (2 * C)

    C = A * e0 / d

    //energy density between plates
    U / (A * d) = U / V = 0.5 * e0 * E^2

    //electric field between two plates
    E = V / d



the force on one electric plate in a capacitor is

    E = sigma * Q / e0

- Basically the electric field on one plate multiplied by the force from the other

**dielectric**
because there is an insulating material *the electric field decreases* because the neutral charge inside the insulating material polarizes the charged conducting material

when a dielectric object is placed between a capacitor, capacitance increases.

- when calculating dielectric constant, you are usually comparing it to air which is constant 1.

    dielectric constant = Uf / Ui + 1 //ratio + the constant of air

The *permittivity* of a dielectric is basically `dielectric constant * e0`

HOW:

A capacitor is made from two hollow, coaxial copper cylinders, one inside the other. There is air in the space between the cylinders. The inner cylinder has net positive charge and the outer cylinder has net negative charge. The inner cylinder has radius 2.00 mm , the outer cylinder has radius 2.50 mm , and the length of each cylinder is 36.0 cm.

If the potential difference between the surfaces of the two cylinders is 80.0 V , what is the magnitude of the electric field at a point between the two cylinders that is a distance of 2.30 mm from their common axis and midway between the ends of the cylinders?
