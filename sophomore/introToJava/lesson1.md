# Setting up java
- Originally, each object compiled from a machine can be only used on that machine
  - every time you port over a java program you have to recompile it.
- Now we have a thing called `bytecode` where when compiled, can be run on any machine with `java virtual machine`.

**program interface**
- every java program needs a class.
- in order to run a class, you have to have a main method inside it
