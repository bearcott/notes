## Logic operations, Truth Tables & Gates

- NOT Gate (triangle) `
- AND Gate (Round, flat) +
- OR Gate (Round, Round) *
- NAND Gate (A * B)` = A` + B`
- NOR Gate (A + B)` = A` * B`
- Exclusive OR (A' * B) + (A * B')
- Exlusive NOR (A * B) + (A' * B')

**universal set of gates** A gate is universal if it can do all operations. e.g {AND, OR, NOT}

*DC resistor circuit*

## Laws

**ohms law**

    V = I * R



**kirchoff's law**

- the current of all points entering a node equal the points exiting the node.
- In any closed loop, the total voltage around the loop = the sum of all the voltage drops in it.

**circuit symbols**
- polarized capacitors can only be put in a certain way
- signal generators generate sinusoidal waves in air.
- a component that generates energy is an **active component**
- a component that uses energy is called a **passive component**
