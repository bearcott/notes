**Set/Reset Latch**
- has an illegal combination that breaks it if used

**D-Latch** designed to avoid illegal condition
- forces S and R to be different


**clock**
- signals make different paths in designed
- latches will immediately respond to change in their input so result will depend on time and order of signal arrival
- a clock provides a synchronization point

**register based circuit**

**kirchoff's law**
- KVL: the net voltage around a closed loop circuit is zero
  - current goes through positive out through negative
- KCL: the algebraic sum of currents in any node is zero
