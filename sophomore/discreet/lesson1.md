#Propositional Logic

propositional calculus or propositional logic

**george boole** *1601 - 1665* formalized logic.

**proposition** is a basic block of logic. They are required to be either `true` or `false`.

*zero is even!*

*p q r s .. * are conventional propositional variables.*

**truth value** of a proposition is denoted by T.

**compound propositions** are formed from existing propositions using logic operators.

**truth table** has a row for each possible value

**conjunction** is true when both components are true

    p ^ q //conjuntion of p and q

*In natural language, there is subtle difference between `and` and `but`*

**disjunction** is false when both components are false. true otherwise.

*when you say `or`, you are saying inclusive or/exclusive or.*
