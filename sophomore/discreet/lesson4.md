# Lesson 4

The **converse** of P -> Q is Q -> P

    if an animal is a healthy cat
    then the animal has 4 legs.

    if an animal has 4 legs
    then the animal is a healthy cat

- these aren't always true

The **contrapositive** of P -> Q is not Q -> not P

    if you finish your vegetables
    then you can have desert.

    if you can't have desert
    then you didn't finish your vegetables.

- these are always true

**inverse** P -> Q is ¬P -> ¬Q

*so it turns out, if u connect all the midpoints in a quadrilateral you get a parallelogram lol*

**predicate logic**

*first order logic*

*predicate* is a prepositional function.
- it inputs a function, outputs TRUE/FALSE

    Q(x,y) : x + y = 10 //real number
    Q(5,4) : 5 + 4 = 10 //FALSE

**Quantifiers**

(upside down A) - For every X; For all X; All
  - universal Quantifiers

(mirrored E) - At least one X; There exists at least one X; Some X;
  - Existential Quantifier

e.g

    ExAyQ(x,y) & Qx = Qy = R+ (positive integers)

    There exists a positive integer X,
    For all positive integers Y,
    X + Y = 10.
