# Sets

a **set** is an unordered collection of well defined objects

    subset: We say that B <= C if
    Ax[(x e B) -> (x e C)]

Let B be a set. Then the **power set** if B P(B) is the set of all subsets of B.

    B = {2,4,6}
    P(B) = {ø, {2}, {4}, {6}, {2,4}, {2,6}, {4,6}, {2,4,6}}

The **cartesian product** or **cross product** of the sets `BxC` is the set of ordered pairs {X,Y}|(x e B) ^ (y e C)}

a **compliment of a set is all elements not in that set**
