# infinite number of primes

Need to know for exam
*theorem* the **prime number theorem** The fraction of the positive integers less than N are that are primes is:

    1/ln(N)

if P is prime `2^P-1` is a mersenne number, if that number is prime then its a mersenne prime.

**PROBLEM LIKE THIS ON EXAM**

Euclids GCD Algo

    GCD(170,390) = 10

    390 / 170 -> get remainder
      = 2 R 50

    50 / 170
      = 3 R 20

    50 / 20
      = 2 R 10

    20 / 10 <- this is GCD
      = 2 R 0


- Log2(N)
