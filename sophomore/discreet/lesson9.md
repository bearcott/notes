# infiniy

if B and C ar sets we say that B and C have the same cardinality |b| = |c| if there is a 1-1 correspondence between them.

**hilbert's hotel**

**cantor's diagonalization theorem**

**some infinities are bigger than others**

if |b| = |n| then b is said to be countably infinite. (listably infinite)

if |b| > |n| then its calld uncountably infinite.
