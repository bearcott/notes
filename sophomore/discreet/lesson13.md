generation of pseudo-random numbers

**Goldbach's Conjeture**

    x = even number; y,z = prime

    Ax[E(x) ^ (x >= 4) -> EyEz[(P(y) ^ P(z)) ^ (x = y + z)]

    For every even number greater than 4 there are two primes that sum to an even number

divides

    We say B|C if B is a factor of C
            ^ divides

mod
