Table of common logical operations

|P|Q|P or Q|P and Q|P xor Q|P bicond Q|
|-|-|------|-------|-------|----------|
|0|0|0     |0      |0      |1         |
|0|1|1     |0      |1      |0         |
|1|0|1     |0      |1      |0         |
|1|1|1     |1      |0      |1         |

- NOT (Â¬)

- OR - if one is true, then true (v)
  - p or q.
- AND - both are true, then true (^)
  - p and q.
- XOR - one is false one is true, then true ((+))
  - p or q, but not both.
- Bi-conditional - both are false or true, then true (<->)
  - p if and only if q.
  - known as *IFF*

The expression `p -> q` is a *conditional statement* which shows that based off condition `p` implies `q`.
- true does not imply false but everything else works.

     if P, then Q.

**truth table operator precedence**
In order of most first:
- NOT
- AND
- OR
- ->
- <->

*if a logical expression is true for all values of its true table, then the expression is called a **tautology***

*if it is false for all is **contradiction***

*if it is conditionally true its **contingent***

A *bit string* is a sequence of zero or more bits. The length of this string is the number of bits in the string.
