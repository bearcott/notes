**heisenberg uncertainty principle**

    the more you know about a particle's position the less you know about its velocity. (vice versa)

# Lesson 5

**Examples**

    Ux = Uy : { kitty cat}

- s(x): x is a smart
- c(x): x is cute
- D(x): x is destructive
- m(x): x is a tomcat
- f(x): x is a non-spayed female in heat
- T(x,y): x wants to mate with y

*Exs(x)* there is at least one smart cat

*Ex[c(x) ^ d(x)]* there is at least one cat that is both destructive and cute.

*Ax[s(x)->¬d(x)]* all smart cats are not destructive

*Ax[(s(x)^D(x))->¬c(x)]* smart and destructive cats are not cute

*AxAy[(m(x) ^ F(y)) -> T(x,y)]* any tomcat wants to mate with any female cat that is in heat.

    Ux = Uy = { planar geometric figures }

- R(x): x is a rectangle
- S(x): x is a square
- Q(x): x is a quadrilateral
- T(x): x is a triangle
- P(x): x is a polygon
- C(x): x is a circle
- D(x,y): x has more sides than y
