# Functions

    **e** denotes `in`
      e.g AxeB = for all x in B

    f : R -> R where F(x) = x^2
        ^domain
             ^codomain

    Let B and C be non-empty sets.
    A function F from b to C F: B->C is a set of ordered pairs in which each element of B occurs exactly once as the first element of an ordered pair. The 2nd element must be from C.

    -----

    B = {2,4,7} C = {R,G,Y,P}

    if F: B->C then
      F = {(2,Y), (4,P), (7,Y)} |F| = |B|
              4  *   4   *  4   = 64

    -----

    Let F: B->C be a function

    we say that F is *1-1* if two different value from domain map to two different value from codomain.
      S = {(2,Y),(4,P),(7,G)}
              4  *  3  *  2  = 24 |B| <= |C|

    -----

    Let F: B->C be a function

    we say F is *onto* if
      AyeC ExeB[(x,y)eF] //the entire codomain is used up
      |B| >= |C|

    -----

    Let F:B->C
    if F is both 1-1 and onto,
    f is said to be a *1-1 correspondence*.
      |B| == |C|

    -----

    if f:B->C is a 1-1 correspondence
    then f^-1:C->B such at
      AxeB AyeC[(x,y)eF -> (y,x)eF^-1]
