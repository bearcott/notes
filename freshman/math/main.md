• = the dot product
**orthogonal** basically means perpendicular..

    a • b = cos(theta)|a||b|
    a • b = x1y1 + x2y2 + x3y3


vectors are orthogonal if `a • b = 0`

*dot product formulas*

    a • b = b • a

    a • (b + c) = a • b + a • c

    0 • a = 0

    ca • b = a • cb = c(a • b)

    a • a = |a|^2

projections

    proj(a)(b) = (a • b)/(|a|^2) * a

*this is the projection of b onto a*

The length of the projection of b onto a is equal to `|b| * cos(theta)`

**cross product**

Two vectors are parrallel only if `a x b = 0`

*formulas*

    a x b = - (a x b)
    a x (b + c) = a x b + a x c
    a x (b x c) = (a • b)c - (a • c)b
    2a x 3b = (2*3)(a x b)
    a x 0 = 0

*important*

    |a x b| = |a||b|sin(theta)

    >> this would be the area of a parrallolegram with |a| being width and |b|sin(theta) as height
